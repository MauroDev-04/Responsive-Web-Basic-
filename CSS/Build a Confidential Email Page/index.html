      <p>To: <span class="blurred">Agent R. Cross</span></p>

        <p>We have an urgent situation. A data leak within our intelligence network has compromised the encryption keys for <span class="blurred">Operation Shadowline</span>. The stolen information includes agent identities, safehouse coordinates, and access protocols to our main servers in Geneva. If exposed, years of covert work could be destroyed overnight.</p>

        <p><span class="blurred">Our sources indicate that Codename: Specter orchestrated the breach.</span> He was last detected moving through the eastern corridor of Prague, using diplomatic channels as cover. Your mission is to intercept him, recover the encrypted drive, and eliminate any trace of our involvement. This must be done quietly — no headlines, no witnesses.</p>
